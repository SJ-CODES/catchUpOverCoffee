# Catch Up Over Coffee
* **Purpose of the app:** 
    This app was created to be a one-stop website for a busy individual to start their day. A user can catch up on news and stock prices, check out local weather, and view their horoscope. They can also view daily affirmations, suggested exercises, nutrition tips, and nutrition quiz questions.

* **Features:** 
News: The app utilizes the MediaStack API to present the user with general news headlines and allow them to search for news stories by category (e.g. business news), keyword (e.g. "covid"), or news source (e.g., CNN).

Weather: The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to present the user with current local weather based on geolocation. Weather search options by ZIP code or by city/state are offered for those who do not have location services enabled. The weather page also links to the National Weather Service radar map.
